# cXc
cXc is an application created with Jetpack Compose using the Camera X library.

## Features

Taking photos and videos with some basic features:
* Tap-to-focus, pinch-to-zoom
* Capture delay
* Choose video quaility

Basic filters and crop mode for photo editing

Photo, video sharing

Some cool features like sticky header, horizontal pager and transitions for better design

Exoplayer for video player

##Â Built With

I tried to use many up-to-date approaches and technologies while developing this application:

* Jetpack Compose
* Camera X
* Exoplayer
* Material 3
* Coil

## TO-DO

* Now we use a library for crop feature(it's very cool and easy to use though), maybe we could change it for our needs and then remove the library.
* Adding more filters for editing photos
* Live filters when capturing photo or video
* Landscape mode
* Add screenshots to here
* and more..
